# Future

- Proper config
- Actually use Gulp instead of hacked-together nodemon/watchify scripts
- Queries
  - "What events are on in room X today/this week/right now"
  - "How many students have a free period in which they're likely to still be around uni?"
- More graphics
  - Line graph of the week's headcount
- Publish screenscraping scripts
